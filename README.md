As a seasoned software development professional with around 4 years of experience, I’ve established myself as a diligent problem solver and collaborative team player. My expertise spans the entire software development life cycle, from analysis and design to development, maintenance, and implementation of enterprise web and client-server applications. Proficient in a range of technologies, including Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I’ve leveraged tools like webpack, Maven, and Gradle to drive application development and management.

Throughout my career, I’ve demonstrated a strong ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams, contributing to the successful execution of various projects. My experience with Agile/Scrum methodologies has enabled me to ensure early and continuous delivery of valuable software. I’m well-versed in version control management with Git and possess a strong understanding of the Agile process, including user stories, iterative development, and continuous integration using Jenkins.

Currently, I’m seeking new challenges and opportunities to make a more significant impact. With a strong foundation in software engineering and a passion for innovative solutions, I’m excited to contribute my skills and expertise to a forward-thinking organization.
