Software Engineer
----------------------------

Hello, I'm Dipesh B C.

I have been developing for the web for over five years and I am currently working as a software engineer at BizFlow Corp. In my role, I contribute to BizFlow's flagship Low-Code No-Code Enterprise application platform. My responsibilities include providing feedback, enhancing features, testing, building demos for our customers, refactoring existing demos, and delivering engaging presentations to the executive team during product releases.

In my spare time, I enjoy learning about new front-end technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the ever-evolving front-end ecosystem. Most recently, I have been exploring new JavaScript frameworks, such as Next.js, to discover innovative ways to build user interfaces and to enhance my skills as a Front End Engineer. Additionally, I have contributed to two well-known open-source projects: react.dev and PWA Builder.
