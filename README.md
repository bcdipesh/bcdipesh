Software Engineer

With over five years of experience in software engineering, I have honed my skills in designing and developing intuitive and high-performing web applications. My proficiency includes React.js, Node.js, and various CSS frameworks like Tailwind. I derive satisfaction from tackling complex challenges and crafting impactful digital experiences. While I am well-versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including TypeScript), and React, I am always open to exploring alternative tools that better suit the specific requirements of each task. Collaboration and teamwork are fundamental to me, as I firmly believe that they are essential components of organizational success.
